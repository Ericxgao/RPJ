## Grendel

Grendel is highly inspired by the Batumi from XAOX. It is a fully voltage controlled, quadruple digital LFO module with a couple of nice features. Each oscillator can be used independently or in one of the 3 other modes: quad, phase and divide. For each oscillator, there are sine, square, saw, ramp, triangle and square waveform otputs available. Voltage control is possible for each oscillatorâ€™s frequency, phase and reset.

The four modes of Grendel can be selected by using the selector on the top. The colors of the 4 flashing leds will also indicate the selected mode, being red for FREE, green for QUAD, blue for PHASE and yellow for DIVIDE.

### FREE LFO MODE

When the FREE mode is selected, all the four LFO's will operate independently. By rotating the knob for each of the LFO's, you can control the frequency.
