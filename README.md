## Grendel

Grendel is highly inspired by the Batumi from XAOC. It is a fully voltage controlled, quadruple digital LFO module with a couple of nice features. Each oscillator can be used independently or in one of the 3 other modes: quad, phase and divide. For each oscillator, there are sine, square, saw, ramp, triangle and square waveform otputs available. Voltage control is possible for each oscillatorâ€™s frequency, phase and reset.

The four modes of Grendel can be selected by using the selector on the top. The colors of the 4 flashing leds will also indicate the selected mode, being red for FREE, green for QUAD, blue for PHASE and yellow for DIVIDE.

### FREE LFO MODE

When the FREE mode is selected, all the four LFO's will operate independently. By rotating the knob for each of the LFO's, you can control the frequency. 

### QUADRATURE LFO MODE

In this mode, the first LFO is the master controlling the frequency of the 3 other remaining LFO's. Each LFO generates a wave that is shifted 90 degrees in relation to the previous one. The knobs and the cv inputs control the amplitude of the signal for each of the 3 lfo's. The knob and the cv of the first LFO control the frequency. 

### PHASE LFO MODE

### DIVIDE LFO MODE
