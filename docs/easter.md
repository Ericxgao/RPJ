# Easter / Resonance filter <a name="easter"></a>
![easter image](./easter.png)

Easter is a resonance filter module that delivers 2 different resonators. One is a standard type and the other is a Smith-Angell resonator. You can choose the filters by clicking the small + and - buttons.

## Controls
Cutoff knob controls the center frequency of the filters.

The Resonance knob of course controls the resonance and acts like other filters. 

With the Wet knob you control the amount of processed sound/signal that will be mixed at the output.

The Dry knob controls the amount of unprocessed sounds that comes from the input straight into the mixed audio output.

The module is an implementation of the formula's and theory from the book [Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Software-Synthesizer-Plugins-Audio/dp/0367510464) from Will C. Pirkle.
